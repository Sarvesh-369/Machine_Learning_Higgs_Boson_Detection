# Higgs Boson Signal Detection

## Overview
This project aims to understand and build a machine learning model that can distinguish between potential Higgs Boson signals and various background processes that mimic such signals. By leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of simulated data that mirrors the properties of Higgs Boson signals and background noise. The features have been engineered to capture the characteristics relevant to signal processing in particle physics. Access to this data is crucial for replicating the study, performing further research, or improving upon the machine learning model.

The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the following Google Drive link:
